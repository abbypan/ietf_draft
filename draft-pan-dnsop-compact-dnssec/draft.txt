1.  Background

   DNSSEC has low adoption rate on SLD [SadDNSSEC].

   The operation burden of fullzone DNSSEC deployment is heavy.

   DNS random subdomain attacks and amplification attacks are commonly
   used distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.  The DDoS
   amplification power of the authoritative server of SLD will be larger
   after deploying DNSSEC [AmpDNSSEC].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Basic terms used in this specification are defined in the documents
   [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC8499].

   *  Authoritative Server: Described in [RFC8499].

   *  Recursive Resolver: Described in [RFC8499].

3.  Compact DNSSEC Scheme

   To encourge the DNSSEC deployment on resource-limited SLD, it is
   resonable to give it a compact DNSSEC deployment scheme.

3.1.  The Resource-limited SLD Publishes Compact DNSSEC Records

   Resource-limited SLD should publish these DNSSEC records:

   *  the delegation signer (DS) record on TLD.

   *  the DNSKEY records.

   *  the RRSIGs for NS/A/AAAA/CNAME/TLSA records associated with NS.

   Resource-limited SLD doesn't publish other DNSSEC records on other
   subdomains.

   Resource-limited SLD doesn't deploy NSEC/NSEC3.

   For example:

    example.com. 345600 IN NS ns1.example.com.
    example.com. 345600 IN NS ns2.example.com.
    ns1.example.com. 345600 IN A 11.22.33.44
    ns1.example.com. 345600 IN AAAA ::11.22.33.44
    ns2.example.com. 345600 IN A 55.66.77.88
    ns2.example.com. 345600 IN AAAA ::55.66.77.88
    _853._tcp.ns1.example.com. 3600 IN TLSA ( 3 1 1
      63cbfcafa3284cc46b1676a99dbc09d8acadf9050cf876de79ac1e5776bbd364 )
    _853._udp.ns1.example.com. 3600 IN TLSA ( 3 1 1
      63cbfcafa3284cc46b1676a99dbc09d8acadf9050cf876de79ac1e5776bbd364 )
    _853._tcp.ns2.example.com. 3600 IN TLSA ( 3 1 1
      63cbfcafa3284cc46b1676a99dbc09d8acadf9050cf876de79ac1e5776bbd364 )
    _853._udp.ns2.example.com. 3600 IN TLSA ( 3 1 1
      63cbfcafa3284cc46b1676a99dbc09d8acadf9050cf876de79ac1e5776bbd364 )

   Therefore, the zone file size of the compact DNSSEC scheme is
   approximate with plain-text DNS, with few RRSIGs.

4.  The Authoritative Server of Resource-limited SLD Deploys Secure
    Service

   [RFC7858] and [RFC9250] defined the encrypted DoT/DoQ service for
   client-to-recursive.

   [RFC9539] discussed the extended deployment of encrypted recursive-
   to-authoritative DNS.

   The authoritative server of resource-limited SLD deploys the DoQ/DoT
   service with self-signed PKI cerificate with TLS connection.

   *  The NS records of the resource-limited SLD should be written into
      the subjectAltName extension field of the self-signed PKI
      certificate.

   *  The public key information of the self-signed PKI cerificate is
      published on associated TLSA records of the NS.

   *  The associated TLSA records are DNSSEC-signed.

   An alternative secure channel solution is [DNSCurve], embeded the raw
   public key into the NS records.

5.  The Recursive Resolver Validates The Compact DNSSEC Records

   The recursive resolver validates the DNSSEC trust chain (Root -> TLD
   -> SLD), and gains the trustworthy A/AAAA records of the NS records
   of the SLD.

   The trustworthy A/AAAA records are the IP addresses of the
   authoritative server of the resource-limited SLD.

6.  Setup Secure Channel for Recursive-to-Authoritative

   The Recursive Resolver setup secure DoQ/DoT channel with the
   authoritative server of the resource-limited SLD:

   *  The recursive resolver connects to the trustworthy IP addresses of
      the authoritative server of the resource-limited SLD.

   *  The recursive resolver receives the self-signed certificate from
      the authoritative server, and extract the public key from the
      self-signed PKI certificate.

   *  The recursive resolver validates the TLSA RRSIGs of the NS records
      of the SLD with the DNSSEC trust chain.

   *  The recursive resolver validates the digest of extracted public
      key match the TLSA record.

   *  The recursive resolver setup secure DoQ/DoT channel with the
      authoritative server of the resource-limited SLD successfully.

   *  The recursive resolver make DNS query with the authoritative
      server of the resource-limited SLD on the secure DoQ/DoT channel.

7.  Security Considerations

   The compact DNSSEC scheme does not cover the entire zone and does not
   deploy NSEC/NSEC3.

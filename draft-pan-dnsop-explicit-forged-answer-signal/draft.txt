                     Explicit Forged Answer Signal
            draft-pan-dnsop-explicit-forged-answer-signal-01

Abstract

   This document describes about the forged answer provided by recursive
   resolver.

   Client could protect user on security and privacy more efficiently if
   recursive resolver gives explict signal in the forged answer.

1.  Background

   Recursive resolver may make a forged answer for a dns query in some
   specific scenarios, such as NXDOMAIN, phishing, fraud, malware,
   ransomware, botnet DDoS attack, and legal requirement, etc.  See also
   [NXRedierct] [ISPRedirect] [DNSFirewall] [LegalRedirect].

   The RCODE of faked answer is NOERROR, which make client hard to
   distinguish it with honest answer, if client doesn't make iterative
   dns query by itself, or make DNSSEC validation.

   Faked answer can avoid user to visit malicious website, however, it
   may also increase the security and privacy risk.

1.1.  HTTP Cookies Leakage

   The HTTP cookies risk has been well discussed in [NXDamageControl]
   and [NXDNSLies].  Furthermore, the risk is not only occured on
   NXDOMAIN scenario, but also on other faked answer scenarios.

   Imagine that user visits "abc.example.com" in browser.

   Recursive resolver return a faked answer to browser.

   Browser will visit the faked server, and leak the HTTP cookies in
   "example.com" of the user to it.

   With the leaked HTTP cookies, the faked server may pretend as the
   user to visit "abc.example.com", result in user's security issue and
   privacy leakage.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Basic terms used in this specification are defined in the documents
   [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC8499].

   *  Authoritative Server: Described in [RFC8499].

   *  Recursive Resolver: Described in [RFC8499].

3.  Explicit Forged Answer Signal

   To avoid the HTTP cookies leakage, the recursive resolver is
   responsible for giving explict forged answer signal to client, and
   client could make its own reaction when it received an explict forged
   answer signal from recursive resolver.

3.1.  Recursive Resolver

   Recursive resolver could give the explict forged answer signal by
   including an additional Extended DNS Errors (EDE) information in DNS
   response, which is defined in [RFC8914].

   Alternatively, recursive resolver could include an TXT RR in DNS
   answer section, such as:

   abc.example.com  300 IN  A  1.2.3.4
   abc.example.com  300 IN  TXT  "faked=malware"

3.2.  Client

   Client could implement its own policy to deal with the forged answer:

   *  Use DNSSEC: Client could make DNSSEC query by itself.  If the
      domain has deployed DNSSEC, the client could validate the honest
      answer from authoritative server.

   *  Change Recursive Resolver: Client could change to another
      recursive resolver which is not lying.

   *  Stop Visit: Client could stop to visit on the website, since it
      knows that the answer is faked.

   *  Limited Visit: Client could make limited visit on the website,
      prevent HTTP cookies from being send to the faked server.  For
      example, browser should not send user's HTTP cookies to the faked
      server, if it gets an explict faked answer signal in the DoH
      response [RFC8484].

4.  Security Considerations

   Faked answer is unauthenticated by authoritative server, just offered
   by recursive resolver on some specific scenarios.  With the DNSSEC
   deployed on second level domain, client would not trust any faked
   answer if it makes all RRSIG validation by itself.  Ideally,
   recursive resolver should be honest to client, give the explicit
   faked answer signal in DNS response.  Explict faked answer signal
   could help browser to mitigate the http cookies leaked to faked
   server, protect user security and privacy in conditional limited
   environment.

1.  Background

   DNS resolver can support any encrypted DNS scheme, such as DNS over
   HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484], DNS over TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], or DNS over QUIC
   (DoQ) [RFC9250].

   Certificate hijacking allows attackers to impersonate a legitimate
   encrypted DNS resolver, see also [MisIssuedCF].

   Certificate Transparency (CT) is to combat the certificate hijacking
   issue [RFC9162].  This document describes the CT information of the
   encrypted DNS resolver.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Basic terms used in this specification are defined in the documents
   [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC9499], [RFC9606], [RFC9162].

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  DNS Resolver Information Keys Registration

   [RFC9606] specifies a method for DNS resolvers to publish information
   about themselves.

   IANA has created a new registry called "DNS Resolver Information
   Keys" [IANA-DNS].

   This document adds a new DNS Resolver Information Key: CT, to present
   the CT information of the encrypted DNS resolver.

   Name: CT

   Value: 1

   Meaning: The value indicates that the certificate of the encrypted
   DNS resolver contains embedded SCTs.

   Reference: RFC 9162

   Name: CT

   Value: 2

   Meaning: The value indicates that the encrypted DNS resolver supports
   the transparency_info TLS extension.

   Reference: RFC 9162

4.  Security Considerations

   DNS clients can get trustworthy DNS resolver information through
   DNSSEC query or out-of-band configuration.

   Suppose the DNS clients find the CT value in the trustworthy DNS
   resolver information.  In that case, they can mandate the CT
   validation in the encrypted communication channel setup process with
   the encrypted DNS resolver.

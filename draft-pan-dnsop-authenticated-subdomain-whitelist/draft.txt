1.  Background

   The DNS random subdomain attack, also referred to as DNS water
   torture attack or pseudo-random subdomain attack, represents a form
   of DDoS attack specifically targeting DNS services.  The attacker
   orchestrates huge amounts of bots to send queries to recursive
   resolvers.  These queries are random subdomains under the victim
   domains, which are not currently cached in recursive resolvers.
   Consequently, the recursive resolvers must forward these queries to
   the authoritative servers responsible for the victim domains.  This
   process places a significant burden on both the recursive resolvers
   and the authoritative servers, potentially leading to service
   degradation or outright failure.

   We describe an authenticated subdomain whitelist (ASDWL) scheme to
   mitigate DNS random subdomain attacks on second-level domains.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Basic terms used in this specification are defined in the documents
   [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC8499].

   *  Authoritative Server: Described in [RFC8499].

   *  Recursive Resolver: Described in [RFC8499].

3.  Prepare Private Key and Certificate for ASDWL

   The administor of SLD should generate a private key priv_wl used to
   sign the ASDWL, and issue an end-entity X.509 certificate Cert_wl for
   the corresponding public key pub_wl used to verify the ASDWL
   signature.

4.  Structure of ASDWL

   ASDWL followes the flattened JWS JSON serialization syntax, contains
   3 parts: payload, header, and signature.

   *  payload: Contains the whitelist subdomains information configured
      by the domain administrator of SLD.

      -  dom: Contains the name of SLD.

      -  date: Contains the publish date of the ASDWL.

      -  subdoms: Contains the subdomain whitelist of SLD.  In this
         example, it means 'abc.example.com'.

      -  wildcard subdoms: Contains the wildcard subdomain zone
         whitelist of SLD.  In this example, it means
         '*.xxx.example.com' .

   *  header: Contains the parameters for the ASDWL signature, followed
      the definition of JSON web signature and encryption header
      parameters in [RFC7515].

      -  alg: Contains the signature algorithm.  In this example, ES256
         means the ECDSA digital signature on Elliptic Curve NIST P-256
         with SHA-256 message digest, followed the definition in
         [RFC7515].

      -  x5c: Contains the X.509 certificate Cert_wl corresponding to
         the key priv_wl used to sign the ASDWL payload.

   *  signature: Contains the signature of the payload, which is signed
      by priv_wl, and verified by Cert_wl.

        {
            'payload': {
                'dom': 'example.com',
                'date': '2023-12-25',
                'subdoms': [
                    'abc'
                ],
                'wildcard subdoms': [
                    'xxx'
                ]
            },
            'header': {
                'alg' : 'ES256',
                'x5c' : ....,
            },
            'signature': ...
        }

5.  Publish ASDWL

   The administor of SLD should define a well-known subdomain
   '_asdwl.example.com' for the SLD 'example.com' to publish its ASDWL
   url address (marked as Url_wl).

   And configure a DANE TLSA RR and a TXT RR for it.

  *  TLSA RR: The TLSA RR indicates the digest of the public key of the
     ASDWL certificate Cert_wl.

  *  TXT RR: The TXT RR indicates the ASDWL url address Url_wl of
     ASDWL.  In this example, the url is 'https://_asdwl.example.com/
     asdwl.json'.

    _443._tcp._asdwl.example.com. 3600 IN TLSA ( 3 1 1
      d2abde240d7cd3ee6b4b28c54df034b97983a1d16e8a410e4561cb106618e971 )

    _asdwl.example.com. 3600 IN TXT
      'url=https://_asdwl.example.com/asdwl.json'

6.  Get ASDWL

   When the authoritative server of SLD detects the random subdomain
   attack, it can attach the TLSA and TXT records of the well-known
   subdomain '_asdwl.example.com' to the DNS answer section.  And then
   the recursive resolver can get ASDWL of the SLD 'example.com' with
   the following steps:

   *  Recursive resolver extracts Url_wl from the TXT RR, and downloads
      ASDWL.

   *  Recursive resolver extracts Cert_wl from the x5c parameter of
      ASDWL.

   *  Recursive resolver extracts the public key from Cert_wl.

   *  Recursive resolver validates the digest of extracted public key
      match the TLSA record.

7.  Recursive Resolver Mitigates Random Subdomain Attacks with ASDWL

   Recursive resolver could mitigate random subdomain attacks with
   ASDWL:

   *  Recursive resolver loads ASDWL payload of SLD ‘example.com’ into
      the DDoS whitelist module.

   *  Recursive resolver makes the mitigation on random subdomain
      attacks:

      -  Recursive resolver allows all the legitimate queries of the
         whitelist subdomains (subdoms) from clients, and sends the
         queries to the authoritative server.

      -  Recursive resolver allows all the legitimate queries of the
         whitelist wildcard subdomains (wildcard subdoms) from clients,
         only sends one query to ASsld for each wildcard subdomain zone,
         and store one response for all queries in each wildcard
         subdomain zone.

      -  Recursive resolver makes rate limiting responses on other
         subdomains queries when it could afford.  Recursive resolver
         drops the queries of other subdomains when the traffic is
         overwhelmed.

8.  Authoritative Server Mitigates Random Subdomain Attacks with ASDWL

   Authoritative server could mitigate random subdomain attacks with
   ASDWL:

   *  Authoritative server detects that recursive resolver has sent many
      random subdomain queries, identifies it may be potential victim
      recursive resolver.

   *  Authoritative server makes the mitigation on random subdomain
      attacks:

      -  Authoritative server allows all the legitimate queries of the
         whitelist subdomains (subdoms) from recursive resolver.

      -  Authoritative server allows all the legitimate queries of the
         whitelist wildcard subdomains (wildcard subdoms) from recursive
         resolver.

      -  Authoritative server makes rate limiting responses on other
         subdomains queries from RS when it could afford.  Authoritative
         server drops the queries of other subdomains from recursive
         resolver when the traffic is overwhelmed.

9.  Security Considerations

   Through ASDWL, the authoritative server of SLD can give an explict
   subdomain list which recursive resolver should make best effort to
   serve.  The recursive resolver to gain the subdomain whitelist
   directly from the authoritative server of SLD from the Url_wl of
   ASDWL.

   It is compatible with DNSSEC, heuristic rule defense systems, and
   machine learning random subdomain defense systems [HeavyHitter]
   [DetectWaterTorture].

   If DNSSEC [RFC9364] has been deployed on the SLD 'example.com', then
   the recursive resolver could make DNSSEC validation on the RRSIGs of
   TLSA/TXT RRs.

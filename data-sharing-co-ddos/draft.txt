                Data Sharing Cooperative DDoS Protection
                  draft-pan-dots-data-sharing-co-ddos

Abstract

   DDoS attacks take place every day globally.  Like Virus Definitions,
   data sharing among DDoS mitigation service providers becomes
   important because it can avoid repeating same detection and
   classification work when the providers try to denfense DDoS attacks.

   This document describes possible mechanisms which implement the data
   sharing cooperative DDoS protection.  The described data models are
   compatible with DOTS protocol.

1.  Introduction

   DDoS attacks are growing rapidly nowadays.  Many sources are involved
   in DDoS attack traffic, such as botnet PCs, compromised Internet
   servers, public DNS resolvers, NTP servers, and free proxy servers.
   Due to the various types of attack sources, more and more DDoS
   protection service providers try to improve their ability to detect
   and classify DDoS attacks, using big data security analytics
   techniques.

   Like Virus Definitions, data sharing among DDoS protection service
   providers becomes more and more important because it can avoid
   repeating detection and classification work and speed up the defense
   to DDoS attack.  The shared defense data can be white-list, black-
   list and identificated source ip addresses list, etc.

   The solutions described in this draft are based on
   [I-D.draft-ietf-dots-architecture], the data sharing models are
   compatible with DOTS protocol.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   Basic terms used in this specification are defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-dots-requirements].

4.  Data Sharing Cooperative Mechanism

   When large internet services encounter high CPU/memory usage DDoS
   Attacks (maybe from distributed zombie network), they constantly
   don't need the flow lead resources of other DDoS protection service
   providers, but urgently need to get security defense analysis results
   in application layer.  Therefore, DDoS protection service providers
   can share the defense analysis data of their own DDoS protection
   system, and get data from others, like [DNSBL] and
   [CLAMWIN-Virus-Definitions] databases.  Moreover, the DDoS protection
   service providers can share different levels of data details to
   different customers.

Internet-Draft  Data Sharing Cooperative DDoS Protection       July 2017


   A customer can fully trust the sharing data from a specific DDoS
   protection service provider.  However, sharing data conflicts may
   occur if a customer subscribes to multiple providers.  The data sets
   from mutiple provider SHOULD be refined before used.  The following
   sections discuss three architectures to implement the data sharing
   cooperative: Single-Trust, Local-Refine, Alliance-Integrate.

4.1.  Single-Trust Architecture

   A customer can pull the sharing data from a specific Anti-DDoS
   Provider.  For example, a website customer can get the latest proxy
   black-list of CC DDoS Attack from the Anti-DDoS Provider, to make up
   local flow filtering policy.

   +-----V-----+           +-----V-----+
   | Customer  <-----------| Anti-DDoS |
   |           |           | Provider  |
   +-----------+           +-----------+
   Figure 1: Single-Trust Architecture

4.2.  Local-Refine Architecture

   A customer can pull the sharing data from a group of Anti-DDoS
   Providers, and refined the data itself.  For example, a authoritative
   dns customer can get recursive resolver dns lists from a group of ISP
   Anti-DDoS Providers, refine the lists satisfied with its netflow
   feature, to build up a best-effort serving white-list for rate-
   limiting, the scenario is also metioned in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-dots-use-cases] Section 3.1.4.

   +-----V-----+           +-----V-----+
   |           |           | Anti-DDoS |
   |           <-----------> Provider  |
   |           |           |    (A)    |
   |           |           +-----------+
   |           |
   |           |           +-----V-----+
   |           |           | Anti-DDoS |
   | Customer  <-----------> Provider  |
   |           |           |    (B)    |
   |           |           +-----------+
   |           |
   |           |           +-----V-----+
   |           |           | Anti-DDoS |
   |           <-----------> Provider  |
   |           |           |    (C)    |
   +-----------+           +-----------+

Internet-Draft  Data Sharing Cooperative DDoS Protection       July 2017


4.3.  Alliance-Integrate Architecture

   Conflicts may occur if more and more Anti-DDoS Providers share their
   data in alliance.  Anti-DDoS Providers push the data to the alliance.
   The alliance SHOULD integrate the data from Anti-DDoS Providers,
   classify the data for different attack scenarios.  Customers can
   choose the data satisfied with their businesses from the alliance.
   For example, a recursive dns service customer can get the latest
   botnet control domain list which is integrated by the alliance, to
   protect infected computers and mobile agents.

   +-----V-----+           |           <-----------> Provider  |
   |           |           |           |           |    (A)    |
   | Customer  <-----------|           |           +-----------+
   |   (X)     |           |           |
   +-----------+           |           |           +-----V-----+
                           |           |           | Anti-DDoS |
                           | Alliance  <-----------> Provider  |
                           |           |           |    (B)    |
   +-----V-----+           |           |           +-----------+
   |           |           |           |
   | Customer  <-----------|           |           +-----V-----+
   |   (Y)     |           |           |           | Anti-DDoS |
   +-----------+           |           <-----------> Provider  |
                           |           |           |    (C)    |

5.  Data Sharing DOTS Protocol

   DOTS protocol can run on HTTPS (with TLS) and support user/
   role:password authentication for data sharing.  Data Provider needs
   to install the SSL Certificate onto its web server to initiate a
   secure session with customers.  The Certificate binds provider's
   company name together with its domain name.

   All of the HTTPS requests APIs are in RESTful style, and the contents
   are in JSON format.  The following sections describe the details of
   data sharing DOTS messages.

5.1.  PULL Data

   Customer can get sharing data from Anti-DDoS Providers or their
   Alliance.
